# Comments

Comments are an essential tool in any programming language, allowing developers to annotate their code with helpful descriptions, reminders, or explanations. In [BuckshotPlusPlus](https://bpplang.com/), comments are used to provide context or to temporarily disable specific lines or blocks of code without deleting them.

## How it works

### Single-line comments

In [BuckshotPlusPlus](https://bpplang.com/), single-line comments are created using the `##` symbol. Any text following this symbol on the same line will be ignored by the compiler.

Here's an example:

```
Test = "cool"
## This line will not be read by the compiler
```

In this example, the text "This line will not be read by the compiler" is a comment and will not affect the execution of the code.

### Multi-line comments

For longer comments that span multiple lines, [BuckshotPlusPlus ](https://bpplang.com/)provides a multi-line comment syntax. You can start a multi-line comment with `###` and close it with another `###`.

Here's how you can create a multi-line comment:

```
Test = "cool"
###
This
Text will not be
Read by the compiler
###
```

In this example, the three lines between the `###` symbols are all part of a multi-line comment and will be ignored by the compiler.

## Use cases

1. **Code Documentation**: Use comments to document your code, explaining the purpose of specific functions, algorithms, or logic.
2. **Debugging**: Temporarily disable certain lines or blocks of code during debugging without deleting them.
3. **Collaboration**: Leave notes or reminders for other developers working on the same project.

## Important notes

* Use comments judiciously. While they are helpful, excessive or unnecessary comments can clutter your code.
* Always ensure that your comments are clear, concise, and relevant to the code they're annotating.
* Remember that comments are for developers, not the compiler. They won't affect the execution or output of your program.
