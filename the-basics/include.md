# Include

### Local includes

If you want to include local bpp files to your project, you just have to do the following:&#x20;

```
include "local/path/to/your/file.bpp"
```

### Network includes

You can include any bpp file accessible trough an https link, to do so use a normal include, but specify the url as shown below:

```
include "https://link_to_your_bpp_file"
```
